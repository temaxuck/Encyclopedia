I'm fucking tired
Will I get any award somewhen for being that unhappy for so long time
Yes I know, that's me who must choose to feel happy and stop cryin that much
But... This ain't that easy...
I feel like everybody hates me or if he doesn't, then he just gives no fucks 'bout me
I think I need someone to care about me...
But who will ever want to...

Well, yeah, may be I'm just that retard who pushes everyone who's trying to help me with something.
I think I just don't notice those ppl.

I'm just a mess.

Yeah I'm jealous of those people, who get cared by their parents or friends...

They only call when they need me.

I don't wanna let someone down, and I don't wanna piss them off, but usually I do it both at the same time
Tha hell... How do I ruin all the good relationships
May be... I need more patience? I think I have it enough... I try to give as much space to everybody as possible.

I'm writing it right now just not to feel so low at this moment.
